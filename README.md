# Tigernet

Tigernet is a minimalistic, open source, cross-platform, backend framework for .NET based on modern systems. The behavior of ASP.NET Core is different from that of Node.js. And we want to develop a lightweight framework to replace Node.js. A special framework for the development of modern technologies such as blockchain, payment systems, cyber security, artificial intelligence. By the way, it will be very easy to develop systems like CRM, Delivering system... You can integrate payment systems through a single provider.
