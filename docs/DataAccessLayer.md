# Querying in DAL with QueryOptions

Querying in DAL (Data Access Layer) is a crucial aspect of software development, and it is often the key to improving performance and scalability. To make querying more accessible and efficient, DAL utilizes QueryOptions, which is a combination of a lightweight query parameter object and expression extension methods.

QueryOptions significantly simplifies the querying process and includes a range of features such as searching, filtering, including (table relationships), sorting, and pagination operations. Moreover, it can be used for queryable and enumerable sets of any objects, including arrays and lists, making it versatile and practical.

In addition, EntityQueryOptions takes QueryOptions to the next level by providing advanced features such as IncludeOptions. It provides the ability to query exclusively for queryable entity sources, making it a powerful tool for software developers who need to work with complex data sources.

# QueryOptions
QueryOptions is used for queryable and enumerable sets of any objects, and it can be used for arrays and lists too. QueryOptions include the following operations:

- Search: allows users to search for specific data within a data source.
- Filter: enables users to filter data based on specific criteria, such as dates or names.
- Include: helps users to include table relationships when querying data.
- Sort: allows users to sort data in ascending or descending order.
- Pagination: enables users to retrieve data in chunks or pages, making it easier to work with large data sources.

# EntityQueryOptions
EntityQueryOptions includes all the features of QueryOptions and provides advanced capabilities, such as IncludeOptions, which is used for querying exclusively for queryable entity sources.

By utilizing QueryOptions and EntityQueryOptions in DAL, software developers can simplify their code, save time, and improve the performance and scalability of their applications.
