# EntityQueryOptions<TEntity> `1.1`
  
`EntityQueryOptions<TEntity>` is a generic class used in the code snippet as a request body for HTTP requests. It is a flexible and versatile option that simplifies the process of querying data in the Data Access Layer (DAL) of a software application.

The class is designed to provide advanced capabilities for querying data from queryable entity sources, allowing developers to build more complex queries with ease. It is particularly useful for querying large data sources and enables developers to retrieve data in chunks or pages using pagination.

# HTTP Request
The code snippet defines an HTTP request method `Get` that accepts an instance of `EntityQueryOptions<User>` as a request body. The `Get` method is decorated with the `[Poster]` attribute, which indicates that it is handling a POST request to the endpoint `/by-filter`.

# Return Value
The `Get` method returns an HTTP response with the `Ok` status code and the result of the asynchronous operation `await _userClever.GetAsync(model)`. The `Ok` method is a helper method that returns an HTTP response with a status code of 200 and the specified object as the response body.

# Conclusion
Using `EntityQueryOptions<TEntity>` as a request body for HTTP requests is a powerful and efficient way to query data from queryable entity sources in the DAL of a software application. By passing the `EntityQueryOptions<TEntity>` object to a service method, developers can simplify their code, save time, and improve the performance and scalability of their applications.
